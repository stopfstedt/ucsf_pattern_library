### Description
This is a list for all articles.

An all articles list should have its own page. Pagination should be included so that a user has greater ability to navigate.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
