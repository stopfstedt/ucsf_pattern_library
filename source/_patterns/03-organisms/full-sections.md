# Full Section Examples

## Description
This group of elements contains layouts for full-page listing results, like all articles or all profiles. Surrounding elements, such as page title and pagination are not included here, but on the page templates. This section is intended to view element interactions, separations, and padding.

## Usage
Full sections contain groups or feeds of smaller elements to create a landing page, and generally include pagination after a certain number is reached.
