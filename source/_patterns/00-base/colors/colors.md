### Description
These are the colors.

### Usage
Colors are the digital or interactive versions of the UCSF Brand master palette, and provide opportunities for greater contrast in order to meet W3Câ€™s Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) AA level color contrast standards. Font size and other details still need to be considered when using colored backgrounds. Visit <a href="http://identity.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">identity.ucsf.edu</a> for precise use cases and applications.

### Accessibility Considerations
Be sure there is sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors.
Ensure that color is not the only means of conveying content or information.
