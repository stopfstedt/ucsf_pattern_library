### Description
These are the fonts.

### Usage
Helvetica Neue Light is UCSF's primary typeface, and Granjon is secondary. Font licenses can be secured through services like myfonts.com; if you need help with this process, contact identity@ucsf.edu. Information on best practices and examples of incorrect usage are available on <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">identity.ucsf.edu</a>.

Arial and Garamond should only be used when our primary and secondary typefaces cannot be procured. Due to default weights and other issues, they will not reflect our brand in the best possible light.

### Accessibility Considerations
Use the most readable fonts. Limit the number of fonts. Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and the background.  Use relative units for font size. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
