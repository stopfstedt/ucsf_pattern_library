# Content Element Style Example

## Description
This section contains the structure for content elements. For example a content element is a sidebar, which can be styled in a few ways. In the future, stylized callouts or specialized content sections can be added here. Content elements normally contain other elements, such as cards, short teasers, or content blurbs.

## Usage
Structured areas allow consistent styling across your site. Once styles are chosen, content elements should be used uniformly to promote a unified experience.
