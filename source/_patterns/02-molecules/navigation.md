# Navigation Examples

## Description
This section contains structures that are used for major navigational elements on the site. Some elements may need to be viewed in context of a page template or sample page for full functionality. 

## Usage
Navigation is essential to guiding people across your site. Whenever possible, keep navigation items short in name and few in number. It's best practice to undergo a card sorting exercise with people who will need to use the site, or people who aren't embedded in the site design process. The top blue navy bar and its menu items are required for all UCSF websites and cannot be altered.
