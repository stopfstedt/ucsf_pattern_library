# Short Teaser Examples

## Description
A teaser is any row-like display of content. Such as an image, article title, and summary. A short teaser is one that is smaller and less content, but still maintains row-like display characteristics. These are commonly used in lists (2 cols of short teasers) or single columns in a sidebar.

## Usage
It's best to use teasers in groups of three or more; isolated teasers can feel awkward and out of place. Make sure to keep text short for legibility and consistency.
