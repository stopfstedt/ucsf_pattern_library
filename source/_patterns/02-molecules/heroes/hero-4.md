### Description
This is hero 4.

### Usage
Hero 4 is image-heavy and takes up a large portion of the page. English users who read left-to-right will take in the banner's text first before looking at the accompanying image, so it's important that the text is carefully considered and fits contextually with its image. Text should be short and succinct. A sliver of the image will be covered by the text area, so image focus should either be at the center or the right. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### SEO Considerations
This section is left intentionally blank and is for future consideration.

### Technical Considerations
There are currently two H1s to show the different font styles (sans serif and serif). In reality, there should only be one H1.

All sliders on heroes use slick carousel and utilize the slick.js file and are included via npm. The Js file can be found in the source/js/vendor folder.  All compilation dependencies are listed in npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
