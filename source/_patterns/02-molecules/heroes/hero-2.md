### Description
This is hero 2.

### Usage
Hero 2 is text-heavy, so you should choose this if your introductory content is more important than any accompanying imagery, but you still have images that you'd like to show off. Don't use imagery that will look uncomfortable with the left third of the photograph covered. Try to choose more abstract visuals, such as architecture, cell structures or landscapes. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### SEO Considerations
This section is left intentionally blank and is for future consideration.

### Technical Considerations
There are currently two H1s to show the different font styles (sans serif and serif). In reality, there should only be one H1.

All sliders on heroes use slick carousel and utilize the slick.js file and are included via npm. The Js file can be found in the source/js/vendor folder.  All compilation dependencies are listed in npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
