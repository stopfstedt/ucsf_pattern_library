### Description
This is hero 5.

### Usage
Hero 5 is a full-width visual splash with a translucent gray overlay, large title text, and a call to action. Hero 5 should only be used to immediately grab a user's attention and convey a short message; there is no space for text beyond a title and a button. Because text will sit over the central portion of the image, image focus should sit within the left or right thirds. Images should look decent cropped at a narrow size, so make sure the original image has a vertically-centered focus. File size should be large enough to display an unpixellated image on desktop, but still come in under 1.5MB. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### SEO Considerations
This section is left intentionally blank and is for future consideration.

### Technical Considerations
There are currently two H1s to show the different font styles (sans serif and serif). In reality, there should only be one H1.

All sliders on heroes use slick carousel and utilize the slick.js file and are included via npm. The Js file can be found in the source/js/vendor folder.  All compilation dependencies are listed in npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
