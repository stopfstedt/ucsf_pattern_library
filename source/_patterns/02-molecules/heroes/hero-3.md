### Description
This is hero 3.

### Usage
Banner 3 is image-heavy and takes up a large portion of the page. English users who read left-to-right will automatically take in the photo first, so it's important that chosen images have a big visual impact and contextually fit the site. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess. Text should be kept short and succinct, keeping in mind that a hero is designed to give a brief introduction to your site before linking a user elsewhere.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### SEO Considerations
This section is left intentionally blank and is for future consideration.

### Technical Considerations
There are currently two H1s to show the different font styles (sans serif and serif). In reality, there should only be one H1.

All sliders on heroes use slick carousel and utilize the slick.js file and are included via npm. The Js file can be found in the source/js/vendor folder.  All compilation dependencies are listed in npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
