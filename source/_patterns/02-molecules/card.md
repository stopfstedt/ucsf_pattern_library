# Card Examples

## Description
Card layouts are commonly used in grids, even if the grid is a single card on a sidebar. The term "Card" is an industry standard in web design and conceptually is like an index card. 

## Usage
Cards display a stylistically consistent set of information that are meant to be used in multiple places. Often a set of cards will be grouped together; they may look strange alone unless placed in a sidebar as a single item. See individual use cases for best practices.
