# Teaser Examples

## Description
A teaser is any row-like display of content. Such as an image, article title, and summary. These are commonly used in lists "All Articles" or "Latest Articles".

## Usage
It's best to use teasers in groups of three or more; isolated teasers can feel awkward and out of place. Make sure to keep text short for legibility and consistency. If using images, be sure that the images contextually match their accompanying text, that they aren't pixellated, and that they are cropped well at a small size.
