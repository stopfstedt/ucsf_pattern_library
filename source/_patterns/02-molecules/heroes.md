# Hero Examples

## Description
UCSF UR has approved a variety of treatments of hero / slideshow experiences to be used on the home page. The intent is to customize the slideshows with your group's imagery and message. 

## Usage
Hero/slideshow text is meant to ground users with a quick introduction of the site before sending them elsewhere, so text should be kept short and should be decipherable to an unaffiliated audience. These heroes should only be used on the homepage. If used elsewhere, it will disrupt a site's hierarchy and confuse an ordinary visitor.
