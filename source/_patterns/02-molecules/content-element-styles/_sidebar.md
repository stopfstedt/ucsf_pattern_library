### Description
These are examples of sidebars.

### Usage
Sidebars are a quick and easy way to add extra content to the body of the page. Sidebars should never extend past the main body area of a page, and should give users additional ways to navigate to content that interests them when relevant. This could mean a specific call to action, a download, a set of related articles or more. Sidebars can have a left- or right-orientation but that orientation should remain consistent across a site.

### Accessibility Considerations
There are no specific requirements for accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
