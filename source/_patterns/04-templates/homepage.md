# Homepage Examples

## Description
This section is dedicated to providing multiple home page templates. Note that many permutations of a home page can use the same layout (see Homepage - Hero 1 through 5) and Homepage (2 Column Footer, Alternate header) with some variations on the organism and sample data level.

At initial development, the Homepage Iteration 1 is the only template with multiple sample page variations applied in the Pages section with different .json files.

## Usage
Homepages are intended to be your site's biggest splash. They need to establish who you are, key areas a user should visit, and why a user should take time to explore your content. Generally, simplicity is best; don't overwhelm a user, but provide guideposts to other pages. Try to structure your content based on order of importance. Think about why your user might be visiting your site and what they need to know first. Plan how your content change will change over time and what will need to be updated. Keep text short, explore different formatting options, and use compelling imagery.
