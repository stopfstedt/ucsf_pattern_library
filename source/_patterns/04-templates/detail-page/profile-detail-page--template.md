### Description
This is the profile detail page.

### Usage
A profile detail page has basic information about the person in question, an area for their personal bio, and an optional list of related publications. Always try to include a flattering, well-cropped image as the thumbnail, and customize information as needed. In Site Builder, this data synchronizes with profiles.ucsf.edu, but the general format can be adopted for other applications.

### Accessibility Considerations
Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including these elements, in context.

Complex menus, sliders, dialogs, tab panels, etc. must all be built to support keyboard accessibility.

For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link.

Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image.

Button color contrast and font size is important. The button description should be descriptive. Be sure to specify the type of button (button, reset, submit).

Many concepts are communicated more effectively with the addition of illustrations, maps, charts, etc.
