# Basic Page Examples

## Description
A Basic Page template conveys the global page structures. A Basic Page can contain a sidebar, or no sidebar. 

Differentiator: it does not have features defined soley for home and specialized landing pages (e.g., the hero slideshow reserved for the home page)..

## Usage
A basic page is very flexible, and can be built piece by piece. In general, you should organize each page's structure based on order of importance. Break up text with a title and subheaders, use lists when possible, add images, and break up content into multiple columns, if it makes sense to do so. For legibility, body text should never run the full-width of a page. Break content into columns, add a sidebar, or add multimedia to make text more narrow.
