# Basic Page Example

## Description
The page samples in this section leverage one of the Basic Page Templates in conjunction with a JSON data file to have realistic examples instead of Lorem Ipsum. Note that the JSON data files contain some configurations to tell the template to display certain information, like the current page in pagination, how many columns to use, and to contain a sidebar or not.

## Usage
A basic page is very flexible, and can be built piece by piece. In general, you should organize each page's structure based on order of importance. Break up text with a title and subheaders, use lists when possible, add images, and break up content into multiple columns, if it makes sense to do so. For legibility, body text should never run the full-width of a page. Break content into columns, add a sidebar, or add multimedia to make text more narrow.
