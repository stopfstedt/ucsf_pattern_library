# Detail Page Examples

## Description
The page samples in this section leverage one of the specific Detail Page Templates in conjunction with a JSON data file to have realistic examples instead of Lorem Ipsum. Note that the JSON data files contain some configurations to tell the template to display certain information, like the current page in pagination, how many columns to use, and to contain a sidebar or not.

## Usage
A detail page is intended for a specific content type. For instance, it could be a news article, a profile, or an event. They have slight stylistic variations based on common information, but will typically have an open area that allows for some flexibility.
