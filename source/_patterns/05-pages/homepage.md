# Homepage Example

## Description
The page samples in this section leverage one of the Home Page Templates in conjunction with a JSON data file to have realistic examples instead of Lorem Ipsum. Note that the JSON data files contain some configurations to tell the template to display certain information, like the current page in pagination, how many columns to use, and to contain a sidebar or not.

## Usage
Homepages are intended to be your site's biggest splash. They need to establish who you are, key areas a user should visit, and why a user should take time to explore your content. Generally, simplicity is best; don't overwhelm a user, but provide guideposts to other pages. Try to structure your content based on order of importance. Think about why your user might be visiting your site and what they need to know first. Plan how your content change will change over time and what will need to be updated. Keep text short, explore different formatting options, and use compelling imagery.
