### Description
These are checkboxes.

### Usage
A checkbox allows a user to select multiple options. Descriptions for each choice should be brief and logical.

### Accessibility Considerations
Fieldset and legend HTML tags should only be used to associate groups of controls when a higher level description (i.e., the legend) is necessary. Single checkboxes or basic radio buttons (such as male/female for gender) that make sense from their labels alone do not require fieldset and legend. Nested fieldsets should generally be avoided.

Form controls must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context. Be sure to validate user input to help avoid user mistakes.
