# Button Example

## Description
This section contains all the approved treatments for buttons. In the future implementation of the color combinations, this section should be built out with the suggested usage of additional secondary colors as call to actions with appropriate font pairings.

## Usage
Buttons should be used to call out desired actions. Colored buttons should be used on a white background, and white buttons should be used on a colored background. Button text should always be short, unique and descriptive (e.g. not "Click here"). Full-width buttons are desirable for smaller areas, such as sidebars or columns.
