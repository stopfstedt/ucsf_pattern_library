# Heading Example

## Description
These are headings.

## Usage
Headings should be used to enhance navigation and information hierarchy. H1 should be used for page titles only, and all other titles should use H2 - H5 according to their level of importance. For visual interest and distinction, it's recommended that both serif and sans-serif are used. For instance, H1 and H2 may be serif, but H3 and H4 be sans-serif. Headers should be used consistently across a site's pages to help orient users.
