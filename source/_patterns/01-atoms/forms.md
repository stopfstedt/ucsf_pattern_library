# Form Examples

## Description
This section contains all form elements and their accessible treatments. Future implementation requires an accessible error-handling treatment for when form elements don't pass validation.

## Usage
Form elements should always have an intelligible order and proper attribution, so that a user can easily understand why and what is required of them. Forms should be tested for screen reader accessibility and responsive design.
