### Description
This is Banner Image 5.

### Usage
Banner 5 is a full-width visual splash that sits behind a translucent gray overlay. Because text will sit over the central portion of the image, image focus should sit within the left or right thirds. Images should look decent cropped at a narrow size, so make sure the original image has a vertically-oriented focus. File size should be large enough to display an unpixellated image on desktop, but still come in under 1.5MB. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
