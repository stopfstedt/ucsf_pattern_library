### Description
This is the Logo Image.

### Usage
Do not create your own logo. All logos must be developed by University Relations. Contact identity@ucsf.edu to request a logo or treatment. Please note that not all groups qualify for having its own logo or treatment designed.

If you do have a logo produced by University Relations, make sure to use the web version in your logo package, which is specifically sized to work on all screen widths and viewports. Visit identity.ucsf.edu for more specifications on ideal display sizes.

Sites without a logo should have a live text site title.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Logo images with text are exempt from some of the accessibility requirements. For instance, there is no minimum contrast requirement. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
