# List Examples

## Description
This section contains stylized ordered and unordered lists. At initial development, there were only standard styles, but this section is intended to define the multiple stylized list treatments in one place. 

## Usage
Lists should be used to delineate a series of items. Lists help a user quickly scan a page for relevant information.
