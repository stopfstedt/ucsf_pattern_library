### Description
These are examples of inline elements.

### Usage
Inline elements should be used sparingly, and only as required to further emphasize information. Simple is better.

### Accessibility Considerations
Generally, inline elements may contain only data and other inline elements. An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element. There are no specific requirements for accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### SEO Considerations
This section is left intentionally blank and is for future consideration.

### Technical Considerations
Anything special technical-wise will be shared here.
