# Image Examples

## Description
This section contains images used in other organisms and molecules across the site. If you create a new organism or molecule requiring a new image size, make the image here first and include it in your other code.

## Usage
Images should meet UCSF Brand Guidelines, which you can review at <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">identity.ucsf.edu</a>. Free images for UCSF websites are available in the Brand Photography Library, accessible through MyAccess. Be careful to select images that will crop well to the chosen aspect ratio, that image file sizes aren't bigger than 1.5MB, that an image is large enough to fit the desired display size, and that alt tag information is added so that users with screen readers can understand each image's context.
