### Description
These are examples of tables.

### Usage
Tables should be used sparingly, because formatting can be frustrating for end users on mobile devices if the data cannot be compressed or expressed easily at a narrow size. Tables should also be used to complement other information, and should not be the main thrust of your webpage.

### Accessibility Considerations
Data tables very often have brief descriptive text before or after the table that indicates the content of that table. This text should be associated to its respective table using the caption element. The caption element must be the first thing after the opening table tag. Data tables have column and/or row headers appropriately identified (using the th element). Tables used strictly for layout purposes do NOT use the th element. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
