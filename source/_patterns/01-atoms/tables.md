# Table Example

## Description
The tables in the section were styled based on the approach used by UCD. They are classic tables and not yet responsive. This section is intended to display approved table styling for true tabular formatted data. Leverage teasers and cards in lists or rows if you are looking for more stylized layout structures. 

## Usage
Tables should be used sparingly; formatting can be frustrating for end users on mobile devices if the data cannot be compressed or expressed easily at a narrow size. Tables should also be used to complement other information, and should not be the main thrust of your webpage.
